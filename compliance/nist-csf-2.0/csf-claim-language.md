## 3. Explicit Non-Claim Language (What NOT to Say)

### 3.1 Prohibited Certification Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions is certified to NIST CSF 2.0"
- ❌ "We are CSF 2.0 certified"
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions holds NIST CSF 2.0 certification"
- ❌ "We have achieved CSF 2.0 certification"
- ❌ "Certified in NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0"

**Reason:** NIST CSF 2.0 does not have a certification program. There is no certification body or certification process for CSF 2.0.

---

### 3.2 Prohibited Compliance Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions is compliant with NIST CSF 2.0"
- ❌ "We comply with NIST CSF 2.0"
- ❌ "CSF 2.0 compliant"
- ❌ "Compliant with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0"
- ❌ "Meets all NIST CSF 2.0 requirements"

**Reason:** NIST CSF 2.0 is a framework, not a requirements specification. There are no "requirements" to comply with. CSF provides outcomes and guidance, not prescriptive requirements.

---

### 3.3 Prohibited Achievement Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions fully implements NIST CSF 2.0"
- ❌ "We have fully implemented all CSF 2.0 controls"
- ❌ "Complete CSF 2.0 implementation"
- ❌ "100% CSF 2.0 implementation"

**Reason:** CSF 2.0 does not have "controls" to implement. It has outcomes to achieve. Our alignment is based on existing controls supporting outcomes, not "implementing" CSF.

---

### 3.4 Prohibited Requirement Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "Meets all NIST CSF 2.0 requirements"
- ❌ "Satisfies CSF 2.0 requirements"
- ❌ "Fully meets CSF 2.0 requirements"
- ❌ "Compliant with all CSF 2.0 requirements"

**Reason:** CSF 2.0 does not establish requirements. It provides a framework of outcomes. Organizations implement controls to achieve outcomes, but CSF itself does not mandate specific controls.

---

### 3.5 Prohibited Validation Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "Validated against NIST CSF 2.0"
- ❌ "Third-party validated CSF 2.0 alignment"
- ❌ "Audited for CSF 2.0 compliance"
- ❌ "Verified CSF 2.0 implementation"

**Reason:** While alignment can be self-assessed and documented, there is no official validation, audit, or verification process for CSF 2.0. Making such claims could be misleading.

---

### 3.6 Prohibited Comparative Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "Exceeds NIST CSF 2.0 standards"
- ❌ "Goes beyond CSF 2.0 requirements"
- ❌ "Surpasses CSF 2.0 expectations"

**Reason:** CSF 2.0 does not establish standards, requirements, or expectations that can be "exceeded" or "surpassed." It provides a framework for organizing cybersecurity outcomes.

## 7. Common Scenarios and Responses

### 7.1 "Are you certified to CSF 2.0?"

**Approved Response:**

"No, MacTech Solutions is not certified to NIST CSF 2.0, as NIST CSF 2.0 does not have a certification program. However, we align our cybersecurity program with NIST CSF 2.0 outcomes, and this alignment is documented in our CSF 2.0 Profile."

---

### 7.2 "Are you compliant with CSF 2.0?"

**Approved Response:**

"NIST CSF 2.0 is a framework, not a compliance standard, so there is no 'compliance' with CSF 2.0. However, MacTech Solutions aligns its cybersecurity program with NIST CSF 2.0 outcomes. Our alignment is documented in our CSF 2.0 Profile, which maps our existing CMMC Level 2 controls to CSF 2.0 functions and categories."

---

### 7.3 "Do you meet all CSF 2.0 requirements?"

**Approved Response:**

"NIST CSF 2.0 does not establish requirements; it provides a framework of cybersecurity outcomes. MacTech Solutions' cybersecurity controls support CSF 2.0 outcomes across all six functions. Our alignment is documented in our CSF 2.0 Profile."

---

### 7.4 "Can you provide evidence of CSF 2.0 implementation?"

**Approved Response:**

"MacTech Solutions maintains a NIST CSF 2.0 Profile that documents our alignment with CSF 2.0 outcomes. The Profile maps our existing CMMC Level 2 controls to CSF 2.0 functions and categories, with references to supporting evidence documents including our System Security Plan, System Control Traceability Matrix, policies, procedures, and evidence documents. The CSF 2.0 Profile is available for review."

---

### 7.5 "How does CSF 2.0 relate to your CMMC compliance?"

**Approved Response:**

"MacTech Solutions' primary cybersecurity framework is CMMC 2.0 Level 2, which is required for DoD contracts. Our CMMC Level 2 implementation includes 110 NIST SP 800-171 controls. We have documented how these existing CMMC controls align with NIST CSF 2.0 outcomes in our CSF 2.0 Profile. This demonstrates that our CMMC implementation supports CSF 2.0 outcomes across all six functions."
