## 3. Explicit Prohibited Language (What NOT to Say)

### 3.1 Prohibited Authorization Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions is FedRAMP authorized"
- ❌ "We are FedRAMP authorized"
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions holds FedRAMP authorization"
- ❌ "We have achieved FedRAMP authorization"
- ❌ "FedRAMP authorized"
- ❌ "FedRAMP Moderate authorized"

**Reason:** FedRAMP authorization requires a formal authorization process through a FedRAMP-accredited 3PAO and JAB or Agency authorization. MacTech Solutions has not pursued FedRAMP authorization.

---

### 3.2 Prohibited Certification Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions is FedRAMP certified"
- ❌ "We are FedRAMP certified"
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions holds FedRAMP certification"
- ❌ "FedRAMP certified"
- ❌ "FedRAMP Moderate certified"

**Reason:** FedRAMP does not have a certification program. FedRAMP provides authorization, not certification.

---

### 3.3 Prohibited Approval Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions is FedRAMP approved"
- ❌ "We are FedRAMP approved"
- ❌ "FedRAMP approved"
- ❌ "Approved for FedRAMP"

**Reason:** FedRAMP approval/authorization requires formal authorization process. MacTech Solutions has not pursued FedRAMP authorization.

---

### 3.4 Prohibited Compliance Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "MacTech Solutions is compliant with FedRAMP"
- ❌ "We comply with FedRAMP"
- ❌ "FedRAMP compliant"
- ❌ "Compliant with FedRAMP Moderate"
- ❌ "Meets FedRAMP requirements"

**Reason:** "Compliant with FedRAMP" or "meets FedRAMP requirements" implies authorization. Use "aligned with" or "designed consistent with" instead.

---

### 3.5 Prohibited Readiness Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "FedRAMP ready" (unless specifically defined)
- ❌ "Ready for FedRAMP authorization"
- ❌ "FedRAMP authorization ready"

**Reason:** "FedRAMP ready" is ambiguous and may imply authorization readiness. Use specific language about design alignment instead.

---

### 3.6 Prohibited Assessment Claims

**DO NOT SAY:**
- ❌ "Validated against FedRAMP Moderate"
- ❌ "Third-party validated FedRAMP alignment"
- ❌ "Audited for FedRAMP compliance"
- ❌ "Verified FedRAMP implementation"

**Reason:** While alignment can be self-assessed and documented, making validation/audit claims could be misleading without formal FedRAMP assessment.
