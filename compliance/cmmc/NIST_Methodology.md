NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology, Version 1.2.1, June 24, 2020
Additions/edits to Version 1.1 are shown in blue
1) Background
a) Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.204-7012,
Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting, requires
contractors and subcontractors to provide ‘adequate security’ to safeguard covered
defense information, hereto referred to, for the purposes of this methodology, as
Department of Defense (DoD) controlled unclassified information (CUI)1, when
residing on or transiting through a contractor’s/subcontractor’s internal information
system or network, and to report cyber incidents that affect that system or network to
DoD. DFARS clause 252.204-7012 further states that to provide adequate security, the
Contractor shall implement, at a minimum, the security requirements in National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171,
Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in Nonfederal Systems and
Organizations. Contractors are also required to flow down DFARS Clause 252.204-
7012 to all subcontracts for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract
performance will involve DoD CUI. Contractors must mark or otherwise identify, in
accordance with direction contained within the specific contract, DoD CUI that is
collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on behalf of the
contractor in support of performance of the contract.
b) DFARS provision 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense
Information Controls, requires, among other things, offerors to represent they will
implement the security requirements in NIST SP 800-171 in effect at the time the
solicitation is issued or as authorized by the contracting officer. To document
implementation of NIST SP 800-171, the contractor must develop, document, and
periodically update a system security plan that describes system boundaries, system
environments of operation, how security requirements are implemented, and the
relationships with or connections to other systems. If implementation of the security
requirements is not complete, companies must develop and implement plans of
action to describe when and how any unimplemented security requirements will be
met.
c) Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) (USD(A&S)) memorandum,
“Strategically Implementing Cybersecurity Contract Clauses,” dated February 5, 2019,
directed the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) to pursue, with
companies for which they administer contracts, the application of a standard
methodology and approach to assess a contractor’s implementation of NIST SP 800-
171 at a strategic (corporate-wide) level as an alternative to the requirement for
DoD is transitioning from the use of the term ‘covered defense information’ in the DFARS to “DOD Controlled
Unclassified Information (CUI), consistent with DoDI 5200.48, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)”

contractors to document implementation of NIST SP 800-171 on a contract-bycontract basis.
2) Purpose
a) The NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology, Version 1.2 documents a standard
methodology that enables a strategic assessment of a contractor’s implementation of
NIST SP 800-171, a requirement for compliance with DFARS clause 252.204-7012.
b) This methodology is used for assessment purposes only and does not, and is not
intended to, add any substantive requirements to either NIST SP 800-171 or DFARS
clause 252.204-7012.
c) DoD will use this methodology to assess the implementation of NIST SP 800-171 by its
prime contractors. Prime contractors may use this methodology to assess the
implementation status of NIST SP 800-171 by subcontractors.
d) This methodology informed the conduct of pilot NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessments
performed by DCMA, in partnership with the Defense Counterintelligence and Security
Agency (DCSA) and the DoD Components, during 2019. DoD will update and codify
this methodology in policy/regulation.
3) Strategically Assessing a Contractor’s Implementation of NIST SP 800-171
a) The NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology enables DoD to strategically assess
a contractor’s implementation of NIST SP 800-171 on existing contracts which include
DFARS clause 252.204-7012, and to provide DoD Components with visibility to the
summary level scores of strategic assessments completed by DoD, thus providing an
alternative to the contract-by-contract approach.
b) The NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment consists of three levels of assessments (see
Section 4 of this document). These three types of assessments reflect the depth of the
assessment, and the associated level of confidence in the assessment results.
c) Assessment of contractors with contracts containing DFARS clause 252.204-7012 is
anticipated to be once every three years unless other factors, such as program
criticality/risk or a security-relevant change, drive the need for a different assessment
frequency.
4) Levels of Assessment
a) Basic (Contractor Self-Assessment) NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment
i) The Basic Assessment is the Contractor’s self- assessment of NIST SP 800-171
implementation status, based on a review of the system security plan(s) associated
with covered contractor information system(s), and conducted in accordance with
3 











NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology, Version 1.2.1, June 24, 2020
Additions/edits to Version 1.1 are shown in blue
NIST SP 800-171A, “Assessing Security Requirements for Controlled Unclassified
Information” and Section 5 and Annex A of this document.
ii) The Basic Assessment results in a confidence level of ‘Low’ in the resulting score
because it is a self-generated score.
iii) The summary level scores resulting from Basic NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessments
should be documented as indicated in Section 6 and Annex B of this document.
b) Medium NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment
i) The Medium Assessment is conducted by DoD personnel who have been trained
in accordance with DoD policy and procedures to conduct the assessment. It is
anticipated that Medium Assessments will be conducted primarily by Program
Management Office cybersecurity personnel, as part of a separately scheduled
visit (e.g., for a Critical Design Review).
ii) The assessment will consist of a review of the system security plan description of
how each requirement is met to identify any descriptions which may not
properly address the security requirements.
iii) The Medium Assessment results in a confidence level of ‘Medium’ in the
resulting score.
iv) The DoD assessor will document summary level scores resulting from Medium
NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessments as indicated in Section 6 of this document.
c) High (On-Site or Virtual) NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment
i) The High Assessment, conducted by DoD personnel who have been trained in
accordance with DoD policy and procedures to conduct the assessment, requires
a thorough on-site or virtual2 verification/examination/demonstration of the
Contractor’s system security plan and implementation of the NIST SP 800-171
security requirements.
ii) The High Assessment is conducted using NIST SP 800-171A, “Assessing Security
Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information.” The assessment will
determine if the implementation meets the requirements by reviewing
appropriate evidence and/or demonstration (e.g., recent scanning results,
system inventories, configuration baselines, demonstration of multifactor
authentication).
iii) An on-site High NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment is the preferred methodology
for a full evaluation of the risk to DoD CUI because of the ability to verify and
validate the effectiveness of the safeguards that implement security
2 A virtual High Assessment was developed in response to the COVID-19 epidemic to allow protections of assessors
and DIB personal to limit travel and exposure of staffs whilst still being able to assess contractor risk. The
government may utilize this methodology in the future as required in response to similar or other scenarios.

requirements defined in NIST Special Publication 800-171. While a High
Assessment maybe be conducted virtually in lieu of onsite, a virtual assessment
will not fully cover all the NIST SP 800-171 requirements, resulting in a less than
full understanding of overall risk.
iv) A virtual High Assessment utilizes the same methodology as the on-site with
added data protections processes enacted to protect the DIB data that is shared
with assessment teams. All data is transmitted through DoD Secure Access File
Exchange (SAFE), is only reviewed locally on each assessor’s computer (screen
sharing is conducted utilizing DoD collaboration mediums that are approved for
processing CUI) and contractor data is destroyed post assessment using NSA
guidance for data destruction. With concurrence from the DIB companies being
assessed, the assessment verifies and examines all documents utilizing the NIST
SP 800-171A methodology minus the demonstration or testing of some
requirements. In some cases, a follow-up on-site assessment of the items not
assessed may be required or requested.
v) The first step in a High Assessment is for the contractor to conduct a Basic
Assessment and submit results to the Department using the procedures in Annex
B of this document. The High Assessment consists of a review of the Basic
Assessment, a thorough document review and discussion with the contractor
regarding the results to obtain additional information or clarification as needed,
combined with government validation that the security requirements have been
implemented as described in the system security plan. Network access by the
assessor(s) is not required.
vi) The High Assessment results in a confidence level of ‘High’ in the resulting score.
vii) The DoD assessor will document summary level scores resulting from High NIST
SP 800-171 DoD Assessments as indicated in Section 6 of this document.
5) NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Scoring Methodology
a) This scoring methodology is designed to provide an objective assessment of a
contractor’s NIST SP 800-171 implementation status. With the exception of
requirements for which the scoring of partial implementation is built-in (e.g., multifactor authentication, security requirement 3.5.3) the methodology is not designed to
credit partial implementation.
b) Conduct of the NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment will result in a score reflecting the net
effect of security requirements not yet implemented. If all security requirements are
implemented, a contractor is awarded a score of 110, consistent with the total
number of NIST SP 800-171 security requirements. For each security requirement not
met, the associated value is subtracted from 110. The score of 110 is reduced by each
requirement not implemented, which may result in a negative score.
5 









NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology, Version 1.2.1, June 24, 2020
Additions/edits to Version 1.1 are shown in blue
c) While NIST SP 800-171 does not prioritize security requirements, certain requirements
have more impact on the security of the network and its data than others. This scoring
methodology incorporates this concept by weighting each security requirement based
on the impact to the information system and the DoD CUI created on or transiting
through that system, when that requirement is not implemented.
d) Weighted requirements include all of the fundamental NIST SP 800-171 ‘Basic Security
Requirements’ - high-level requirements which, if not implemented, render ineffective
the more numerous ‘Derived Security Requirements’; and a subset of the ‘Derived
Security Requirements’- requirements that supplement the Basic Security
Requirements - which, if not implemented, would allow for exploitation of the
network and its information.
i) For security requirements that, if not implemented, could lead to significant
exploitation of the network, or exfiltration of DoD CUI, 5 points are subtracted
from the score of 110. For example, failure to limit system access to authorized
users (Basic Security Requirement 3.1.1) renders all the other Access Control
requirements ineffective, allowing easy exploitation of the network; failure to
control the use of removable media on system components (Derived Security
Requirement 3.8.7) could result in massive exfiltration of CUI and introduction of
malware.
(1) Basic Security Requirements with a value of 5 points include 3.1.1, 3.1.2,
3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3.1, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.7.2, 3.8.3, 3.9.2,
3.10.1, 3.10.2, 3.12.1, 3.12.3, 3.13.1, 3.13.2, 3.14.1, 3.14.2, and 3.14.3.
(2) Derived Security Requirements with a value of 5 points include 3.1.12,
3.1.13, 3.1.16, 3.1.17, 3.1.18, 3.3.5, 3.4.5, 3.4.6, 3.4.7, 3.4.8, 3.5.10, 3.7.5,
3.8.7, 3.11.2, 3.13.5, 3.13.6, 3.13.15, 3.14.4, and 3.14.6.
ii) For Basic and Derived Security Requirements that, if not implemented, have a
specific and confined effect on the security of the network and its data, 3 points
are subtracted from the score of 110. For example, failure to limit access to CUI
on system media to authorized users (Security Requirement 3.8.2) or failure to
encrypt CUI stored on a mobile device (Security Requirement 3.1.19), put the CUI
stored on the system media or mobile device at risk, but not the CUI stored on
the network itself.
(1) Basic Security Requirements with a value of 3 points include 3.3.2, 3.7.1,
3.8.1, 3.8.2, 3.9.1, 3.11.1, and 3.12.2.
(2) Derived Security Requirements with a value of 3 points include 3.1.5,
3.1.19, 3.7.4, 3.8.8, 3.13.8, 3.14.5, and 3.14.7.
iii) All remaining Derived Security Requirements, if not implemented, have a limited
or indirect effect on the security of the network and its data. For these, 1 point
6 






NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology, Version 1.2.1, June 24, 2020
Additions/edits to Version 1.1 are shown in blue
is subtracted from the score of 110. For example, failing to prevent reuse of
identifiers for a defined period (Security Requirement 3.5.5) could allow a user
access to CUI to which they were not approved.
e) Two Derived Security Requirements can be partially effective even if not completely or
properly implemented, and the points deducted should be adjusted depending on
how the security requirement is implemented.
i) Multi-factor authentication (MFA) (Security Requirement 3.5.3) is typically
implemented first for remote and privileged users (since these users are both
limited in number and more critical) and then for the general user, so 3 points
are subtracted from the score of 110 if MFA is implemented only for remote and
privileged users; 5 points are subtracted from the score of 110 if MFA is not
implemented for any users.
ii) FIPS validated encryption (Security Requirement 3.13.11) is required to protect
the confidentiality of CUI. If encryption is employed, but is not FIPS validated, 3
points are subtracted from the score of 110; if encryption is not employed, 5
points are subtracted from the score of 110.
f) Although not common, future revisions of NIST SP 800-171 may add, delete or
substantively revise security requirements. When this occurs, a value will be assigned
to any new or modified requirements in accordance with this scoring methodology.
g) The contractor must have a system security plan (Basic Security Requirement 3.12.4)
in place to describe each covered contractor information system, and a plan of action
(Basic Security Requirement 3.12.2) in place for each unimplemented security
requirement to describe how and when the security requirement will be met.
i) Since the NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment scoring methodology is based on the
review of a system security plan describing how the security requirements are
met, it is not possible to conduct the assessment if the information is not
available. The absence of a system security plan would result in a finding that
‘an assessment could not be completed due to incomplete information and
noncompliance with DFARS clause 252.204-7012.’
ii) Plans of action addressing unimplemented security requirements are not a
substitute for a completed requirement. Security requirements not
implemented, whether a plan of action is in place or not, will be assessed as ‘not
implemented.’ For example, if the initial roll-out of 3.5.3, multifactor
authentication, is only 75% complete, and there is a plan of action still being
implemented, 3.5.3 will be considered ‘not implemented’, as the requirement
has not been fully implemented.
iii) A lack of plan of action for unimplemented security requirements will result in
Security Requirement 3.12.2 being assessed as ‘not implemented.’

h) Temporary deficiencies and/or isolated enduring exceptions which occur during initial
implementation, or arise after implementation, are to be expected in most complex
environments.
i) Temporary deficiencies that are appropriately addressed in plans of action (i.e.,
include deficiency reviews, milestones, and show progress towards the
implementation of corrections to reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities)
should be assessed as ‘implemented.’ For example, when a plan of action
addresses a ‘temporary deficiency’ that arises after implementation (e.g.,
3.13.11, employ FIPS validated cryptography, had been implemented, but
subsequently a patch invalidated the FIPS validation of a particular cryptographic
module), the requirement will be scored ‘as implemented.’ A ‘temporary
deficiency’ may also arise during initial implementation of a NIST SP 800-171
requirement if, during roll-out, specific issues with certain equipment is
discovered that has to be separately addressed (e.g., certain specific hardware or
software unexpectedly needs to be changed for the requirement to be
successfully applied). If the implementation roll-out has otherwise been
completed, this ‘temporary deficiency’ plan of action would be considered, and
the requirement scored ‘as implemented.’ There is no standard duration for
which a ‘temporary deficiency’ may be active. It is what is reasonable, which
would take into consideration the availability of the solution, the cost and time
to implement, the overall risk and whether any mitigations are applied in the
interim. Generally, deficiencies should be resolved as soon as is reasonably
possible.
ii) Isolated enduring exceptions encountered during implementation, such as
unique equipment or environments (e.g., specialized manufacturing equipment
or a unique laboratory environment) may prevent the implementation of certain
security requirements. Isolated enduring exceptions are typically not suitable to
address in plans of action, but when described, along with any mitigations, in the
system security plan such exceptions should be assessed as ‘implemented.’
i) For certain requirements, questions often arise on whether or not they are actually
implemented. These situations are addressed below:
i) Security Requirements 3.1.12, 3.1.16, 3.1.18: Companies commonly do not
allow remote access, wireless access or connection of mobile devices and may
indicate these requirements as ‘Not Applicable’ or ‘Not Implemented’ in the
system security plan. The evaluator should not deduct points in such cases.
However, if the company disallows use of remote, wireless, or mobile access,
they should also have a policy and procedure in place to insure these capabilities
are not enabled inadvertently. This should be discussed as part of the Medium8 







NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology, Version 1.2.1, June 24, 2020
Additions/edits to Version 1.1 are shown in blue
Level assessment, and if such policy and procedures are not in place a point
should be assessed.
ii) Security Requirement 3.13.8: When implementing this requirement, encryption,
though preferred, is not required if using common-carrier provided
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), as the MPLS separation provides sufficient
protection without encryption.
iii) Security Requirement 3.13.11: Cryptography used to protect the confidentiality
of CUI must be FIPS-validated, which means the cryptographic module has to
have been tested and validated to meet FIPS 140-1 or-2 requirements. Simply
using an approved algorithm (e.g., FIPS 197 for AES) is not sufficient - the module
(software and/or hardware) used to implement the algorithm must be
separately validated under FIPS 140. Note however, that this is required when
encryption is required for protection, which is typically external to the
contractor's covered information system (assuming the system meets NIST SP
800-171). Cryptography used for other purposes within the protected
information system need not be FIPS validated. When required, if encryption is
not employed (FIPS validated or otherwise), 5 points are subtracted from the
score of 110. If encryption is employed, but is not FIPS validated, 3 points are
subtracted from the score of 110. Isolated use of non-FIPS validated
cryptography, with an associated Plan of Action, should be treated as a
temporary deficiency and assessed as ‘implemented.’
j) If a contractor received a favorable adjudication from the DoD CIO indicating that a
requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure is equally
effective in accordance with DFARS 252.204-7008 or 7012, the DoD CIO assessment
should be included in the Contractor’s system security plan. Implemented security
measures adjudicated by the DoD CIO as equally effective, and security requirements
approved by the DoD CIO as ‘not applicable,’ will be assessed as ‘implemented.’ Once
DOD CIO assessments approving “not applicable” requirements or “alternative
security measures” are included in the Contractor's system security plan, the
contractor does not need to submit that documentation for every current contract
with the DFARS 252.204-7012 clause unless specifically requested to do so by the
contracting officer. When completing the Basic (Contractor Self-Assessment) NIST SP
800-171 DoD Assessment Results Format, the contractor shall score any security
requirements for which an assessment of “not applicable” or “alternative security
measures” was previously approved by DoD CIO as ‘implemented’.
k) A template illustrating the application of this scoring methodology is provided at
Annex A of this document.
l) DoD will provide medium and high assessment results to the Contractor and offer the
opportunity for rebuttal and adjudication of assessment results. Upon completion of
9 





NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology, Version 1.2.1, June 24, 2020
Additions/edits to Version 1.1 are shown in blue
each assessment, the assessed contractor has 14 business days to provide additional
information to the assessment team, to demonstrate that they meet any security
requirements not observed by the assessment team or to rebut the findings that may
be of question.
6) Documenting NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Results
a) A summary level score for basic assessments completed by the Contractor, and for
medium and high assessments conducted by DoD, will be posted in the Supplier
Performance Risk System (SPRS) to provide DoD Components with visibility to the
results of strategic assessments.
i) SPRS is defined by DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5000.79, Defense-wide Sharing and
Use of Supplier and Product Performance Information, October 15, 2019
available at https:\\www.esd.whs.mil/DD/.
ii) SPRS is the authoritative source to retrieve supplier and product performance
information for the DoD acquisition community to assess and monitor
unclassified performance, and to assess corporate business practices related to
DoD contracts and the supplier’s management of risk.
b) Assessment results posted in SPRS are available to DoD personnel, and are protected,
in accordance with the standards set forth in DoD Instruction 5000.79, Defense-wide
Sharing and Use of Supplier and Product Performance Information (PI), available at
https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500079p.PDF?v
er=2019-10-15-115609-957. Authorized representatives of the Contractor for which
the assessment was conducted may access SPRS to view their own results in
accordance with the SPRS Software User’s Guide for Awardees/Contractors available
at https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/pdf/SPRS_Awardee.pdf.
c) A contractor may post the results of their Basic Assessments conducted in
accordance with Section 5 and Annex B of this document in SPRS (via the
Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE)).
d) DoD will post the following Medium and/or High NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment
results to SPRS for each system security plan assessed:
i) The standard assessed (e.g., NIST SP 800-171 Rev 1).
ii) Organization conducting the assessment, e.g., DCMA, or a specific organization
(identified by Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC) or
Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code).
iii) Each system security plan assessed, mapped to the specific industry CAGE
code(s) associated with the information system(s) addressed by the system
security plan. All corporate CAGE codes must be mapped to all appropriate
10 







NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology, Version 1.2.1, June 24, 2020
Additions/edits to Version 1.1 are shown in blue
system security plan(s) if the contractor has more than one system security plan
and CAGE code. Additionally, a brief description of the system security plan
architecture may be required if more than one plan exists.
iv) Date and level of the assessment, i.e., basic, medium, or high.
v) Summary level score (e.g., 105 out of 110), but not the individual value assigned
for each requirement.
vi) Date a score of 110 is expected to be achieved (i.e., all requirements
implemented) based on information gathered from associated plan(s) of action
developed in accordance with NIST SP 800-171.
e) Department policy/procedures/guidance will be updated to direct
acquisition/procurement officials and contractors to access SPRS to determine if a
strategic assessment has been conducted.
f) DoD Components should rely on assessment results posted in SPRS in lieu of
including requirements to assess implementation of NIST SP 800-171 on a contractby-contract basis.
g) A High NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment may result in documentation in addition to
that listed in 6) d) of this document. DoD will retain and protect any such
documentation as For Official Use Only (FOUO) and intended for internal DoD use
only. The information will be protected against unauthorized use and release,
including through the exercise of applicable exemptions under the Freedom of
Information Act (e.g., Exemption 4 covers trade secrets and commercial or financial
information obtained from a contractor that is privileged or confidential).
7) Glossary of Terms
a) Enduring exception. Remediation is not feasible; no plan of action required; must be
documented within a system security plan.
b) Temporary deficiency. Remediation of deficiency is feasible; known fix is in process;
requires a plan of action. For the purposes of a DoD NIST SP 800-171 DoD
Assessment, a ‘temporary deficiency’ is not based on an ‘in progress’ initial
implementation of the requirement. A temporary deficiency arises after
implementation. A Temporary deficiency may also apply during the initial
implementation of a NIST SP 800-171 requirement if, during roll-out, specific issues
with certain equipment is discovered that has to be separately addressed.

Annex A - NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Scoring Template
• The following template illustrates the scoring methodology described in Section 5. If all
requirements are met, a score of 110 is awarded. For each requirement not met, the
associated value is subtracted from 110. Consistency results from the fact that the
assessments are based on what is not yet implemented, or document that all requirements
have been met.
• It is important to note an assessment is about the extent to which the company has
implemented the requirements. It is not a value judgement about the specific approach to
implementing – in other words, all solutions that meet the requirements are acceptable.
This is not an assessment of one solution compared to another.
• Scoring for Basic, Medium, and High NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessments is the same.
• While NIST does not prioritize requirements in terms of impact, certain requirements do
have more impact than others. In this scoring methodology security requirements are
weighted based on their effect on the information system and DoD CUI created on or
transiting that system.

Annex B - Basic (Contractor Self-Assessment) NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment
Results Format
• Score your implementation of the security requirements in NIST SP 800-171 based on
Section 5 and Annex A of this document.
• Document your Basic (self) NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment score in Supplier Performance
Risk System (SPRS). A Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) account with
a SPRS “Cyber Vendor” role will be required to enter Basic Assessment information into
SPRS. This role may be requested through PIEE.
• Information required for entering results of a Basic NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment into
SPRS include:
- Date of the assessment
- Summary level score (e.g., 95 out of 110, NOT the individual value for each
requirement)
- Scope of the Basic Assessment - Identify each system security plan (security
requirement 3.12.4) supporting the performance of this contract. All company CAGE
codes must be mapped to the appropriate system security plan(s). Additionally, a
brief description of the plan architecture may be required, if more than one plan
exists.
 Select Open CAGE Hierarchy to choose CAGEs covered by the system security
plan.
 Note: if a CAGE does not appear in the hierarchy, update your company’s
records in the System for Award Management (SAM); ensure immediate/
highest level owner CAGEs are correctly indicated. SPRS will normally be
updated within 24 hours.
- Plan of Action Completion Date – date that a score of 110 is expected to be achieved
for each system security plan assessed (i.e., all requirements implemented) based on
information gathered from associated plan(s) of action developed in accordance
with NIST SP 800-171 (security requirement 3.12.2).
