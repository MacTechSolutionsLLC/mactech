# System Control Traceability Matrix (SCTM) - CMMC Level 2

**Document Version:** 1.5  
**Date:** 2026-01-23  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Classification:** Internal Use  
**Compliance Framework:** CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (Advanced)  
**Reference:** NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 (All 110 Requirements)

**Applies to:** CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (FCI and CUI system)

---

## 1. Purpose

This System Control Traceability Matrix (SCTM) provides a comprehensive mapping of all 110 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 requirements to their implementation, supporting policies, procedures, evidence, and status. This matrix enables assessors to trace each control from requirement to implementation to evidence.

**Admin Interface:** The SCTM is fully editable via the admin web interface at `/admin/compliance/sctm`. Administrators can update control status, policy references, procedure references, evidence locations, implementation details, and SSP section references directly through the UI without requiring file edits.

---

## 2. Matrix Structure

**For each control, the SCTM provides:**
- Control ID and requirement text
- Implementation status (Implemented/Inherited/Partially Satisfied/Not Implemented/Not Applicable)
- Policy reference
- Procedure reference
- Evidence location
- Implementation location (code/system)
- SSP section reference

**Note on Google VM (Ubuntu) Infrastructure:**
The Google VM (cui-vault-jamy) running the CUI vault infrastructure is now part of the system boundary. Many controls have VM-specific implementation requirements in addition to application-level implementations. For comprehensive VM control mapping and VM-specific evidence, see:
- **VM Control Mapping:** `../01-system-scope/MAC-IT-307_Google_VM_Control_Mapping.md`
- **VM Baseline Configuration:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-129_Google_VM_Baseline_Configuration.md`
- **VM Security Configuration:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-130_Google_VM_Security_Configuration.md`
- **VM Maintenance Procedures:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-131_Google_VM_Maintenance_Procedures.md`
- **VM Monitoring and Logging:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-132_Google_VM_Monitoring_Logging.md`
- **VM Gap Analysis:** `../05-evidence/MAC-RPT-133_Google_VM_Gap_Analysis.md`

Controls with significant VM-specific requirements are noted in the Evidence column with VM-specific evidence documents.

### 4.1 Code Implementation

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to authorize wireless access before allowing such connections. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment (Railway platform). The organization does not maintain any on-premises infrastructure, servers, or network equipment that would require wireless access authorization.

2. **No Organizational Wireless Infrastructure**: The organization does not deploy, manage, or maintain any wireless access points, wireless networks, or wireless infrastructure. All system access occurs through standard web browsers over HTTPS connections to the cloud-hosted application.

3. **Remote Access Model**: All user access to the system is remote and occurs through standard web browsers. There are no organizational wireless networks that users connect to in order to access the system. Users access the system from their own networks (home, office, mobile) using standard internet connectivity.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to organizational infrastructure where the organization directly manages wireless access points and must authorize wireless connections. Since the organization has no such infrastructure, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the organization does not maintain any wireless infrastructure that would require authorization controls. All system access is cloud-based and occurs through standard web browsers over standard internet connections.

#### Testing and Verification

**Verification Methods:**
- Code review: Verify implementation code exists
- Operational testing: Verify control functions as specified
- Configuration review: Verify settings are properly configured

**Test Results:**

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** ## 4. Implementation Evidence

### 4.1 Code Implementation

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to protect wireless access using authentication and encryption. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment (Railway platform). The organization does not maintain any on-premises infrastructure, servers, or network equipment that would require wireless access protection.

2. **No Organizational Wireless Infrastructure**: The organization does not deploy, manage, or maintain any wireless access points, wireless networks, or wireless infrastructure. All system access occurs through standard web browsers over HTTPS connections to the cloud-hosted application.

3. **Remote Access Model**: All user access to the system is remote and occurs through standard web browsers. There are no organizational wireless networks that users connect to in order to access the system. Users access the system from their own networks (home, office, mobile) using standard internet connectivity.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to organizational infrastructure where the organization directly manages wireless access points and must protect wireless connections. Since the organization has no such infrastructure, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the organization does not maintain any wireless infrastructure that would require protection controls. All system access is cloud-based and occurs through standard web browsers over standard internet connections, with protection provided by TLS/HTTPS encryption.

<summary><strong>3.5.9</strong> - Temporary passwords</summary>

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** Temporary password functionality implemented. System generates cryptographically secure temporary passwords for new user accounts and password resets. Users must change temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately upon first login. Temporary passwords expire after 72 hours.

### 4.1 Code Implementation

#### Temporary Password Generation

**Implementation Files:**
- `lib/temporary-password.ts` - Core temporary password generation library
  - `generateTemporaryPassword()` (lines 30-60) - Generates 20-character cryptographically secure random password using `crypto.randomBytes()`
  - `getTemporaryPasswordExpiration()` (lines 95-100) - Returns expiration timestamp (72 hours from now)
  - `TEMPORARY_PASSWORD_CONFIG` (lines 10-18) - Configuration constants (minLength: 16, defaultLength: 20, expirationHours: 72)

**User Creation:**
- `app/api/admin/create-user/route.ts` (lines 41-43, 49-56, 114-120)
  - Line 42: `generateTemporaryPassword()` - Generates temporary password
  - Line 43: `getTemporaryPasswordExpiration()` - Sets 72-hour expiration
  - Lines 49-56: Creates user with `isTemporaryPassword: true`, `temporaryPasswordExpiresAt`, `mustChangePassword: true`
  - Lines 114-120: Returns temporary password in API response

**Password Reset:**
- `app/api/admin/reset-user-password/route.ts` (lines 48-50, 65-74, 104-111)
  - Line 49: `generateTemporaryPassword()` - Generates temporary password
  - Line 50: `getTemporaryPasswordExpiration()` - Sets 72-hour expiration
  - Lines 65-74: Updates user with `isTemporaryPassword: true`, `temporaryPasswordExpiresAt`, `mustChangePassword: true`
  - Lines 104-111: Returns temporary password in API response

#### Expiration Checking

**Implementation Files:**
- `lib/temporary-password.ts`
  - `isTemporaryPasswordExpired()` (lines 82-89) - Validates if temporary password has expired
  - `validateTemporaryPasswordExpiration()` (lines 131-137 in `lib/password-policy.ts`) - Additional validation function

**Authentication:**
- `lib/auth.ts` (lines 83-93)
  - Lines 86-93: Checks `user.isTemporaryPassword` and `user.temporaryPasswordExpiresAt`
  - Line 88: Calls `isTemporaryPasswordExpired()` to validate expiration
  - Line 92: Rejects login if temporary password expired

**Database Schema:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 22-23)
  - `isTemporaryPassword: Boolean @default(false)` - Flag indicating temporary password
  - `temporaryPasswordExpiresAt: DateTime?` - Expiration timestamp

#### Forced Password Change

**Implementation Files:**
- `middleware.ts` (lines 38-43, 61-66)
  - Lines 39-42: Checks `session.user?.mustChangePassword` for `/user` routes, redirects to `/auth/change-password`
  - Lines 62-65: Checks `session.user?.mustChangePassword` for `/admin` routes, redirects to `/auth/change-password`
  - Lines 20-22: Allows `/auth/change-password` route without restriction

**Password Change:**
- `app/api/auth/change-password/route.ts` (lines 95-105, 131-147)
  - Lines 97-98: Detects if changing from temporary password (`wasTemporaryPassword`)
  - Lines 99-105: Updates user with `isTemporaryPassword: false`, `temporaryPasswordExpiresAt: null`, `mustChangePassword: false`
  - Lines 131-147: Logs temporary to permanent password change in audit trail

**Sign-In Flow:**
- `app/api/auth/custom-signin/route.ts` (lines 99-110)
  - Lines 100-110: Checks `user.mustChangePassword` BEFORE MFA enrollment
  - Returns `requiresPasswordChange: true` if password change needed
- `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` (lines 37-44)
  - Lines 37-44: Redirects to `/auth/change-password?required=true` if password change required
  - Ensures password change happens before MFA enrollment

**MFA Enrollment Protection:**
- `app/api/auth/mfa/enroll/route.ts` (lines 22-30)
  - Lines 22-30: Checks for `mustChangePassword` and rejects MFA enrollment if password change required
- `app/auth/mfa/enroll/page.tsx` (lines 18-38)
  - Lines 18-38: Client-side check for password change requirement, redirects if needed

**Features:**
- Cryptographically secure random password generation (20 characters) - `lib/temporary-password.ts:generateTemporaryPassword()`
- 72-hour expiration for temporary passwords - `lib/temporary-password.ts:getTemporaryPasswordExpiration()`
- Forced password change on first login - `middleware.ts` (lines 38-43, 61-66)
- Expired temporary passwords rejected at login - `lib/auth.ts` (lines 83-93)
- Audit logging for temporary password operations - `app/api/admin/create-user/route.ts`, `app/api/admin/reset-user-password/route.ts`, `app/api/auth/change-password/route.ts`

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to sanitize equipment containing CUI before releasing it for off-site maintenance. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment. CUI is stored exclusively in the CUI vault on Google Cloud Platform. The organization does not own, maintain, or have physical custody of any equipment (servers, storage devices, network equipment) that contains CUI or system components.

2. **No Customer Equipment**: The organization does not maintain any physical equipment that would require off-site maintenance. All system infrastructure is managed by the cloud service provider (Railway), and the organization has no physical access to or ownership of the underlying hardware.

3. **No Physical Media**: The system operates entirely in a digital environment with no physical media (hard drives, tapes, USB devices) that could be removed for maintenance. All data is stored in cloud databases with no physical storage components under organizational control.

4. **Service Provider Responsibility**: Equipment maintenance, including any sanitization requirements, is the responsibility of the cloud service provider (Railway). The organization has no equipment to sanitize or release for maintenance.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the organization does not own, maintain, or have physical custody of any equipment that would require sanitization before off-site maintenance. All system infrastructure is cloud-based and managed by the service provider.

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to mark media containing CUI with appropriate CUI markings. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Digital-Only Environment**: The system operates entirely in a digital environment with no physical media (hard drives, tapes, USB devices, CDs, DVDs, printed materials) that contains CUI. All CUI is stored in cloud databases and accessed through web browsers.

2. **No Physical Media**: The organization does not create, use, or maintain any physical media (removable storage devices, printed documents, backup tapes) that would require CUI markings. All data storage and access is digital and cloud-based.

3. **Cloud Storage**: All CUI is stored exclusively in the CUI vault database on Google Cloud Platform with no physical storage components under organizational control. Railway infrastructure is prohibited from CUI storage. There are no physical media items that could be marked with CUI designations.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to physical media that contains CUI and must be marked to indicate the presence and handling requirements of CUI. Since the organization does not use physical media, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the organization does not use, maintain, or have custody of any physical media that contains CUI. All CUI is stored digitally in cloud databases with no physical media requiring markings.

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to control access to media containing CUI during transport. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment. CUI is stored exclusively in the CUI vault on Google Cloud Platform. The organization does not transport any physical media (hard drives, tapes, USB devices, printed documents) that contains CUI.

2. **No Physical Media Transport**: The organization does not create, use, or transport any physical media (removable storage devices, printed documents, backup tapes) that would require access controls during transport. All data storage and access is digital and cloud-based.

3. **Digital Data Transfer**: All CUI is transferred digitally over encrypted connections (TLS/HTTPS) through web browsers. There is no physical transport of media containing CUI that would require access controls.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to physical media containing CUI that must be transported and requires access controls during transport. Since the organization does not transport physical media, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** ## 4. Implementation Evidence

### 4.1 Code Implementation

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to establish usage restrictions and implementation guidance for collaborative computing devices. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Web Application Architecture**: The system is a web application accessed through standard web browsers. The organization does not deploy, manage, or maintain any collaborative computing devices (video conferencing systems, interactive whiteboards, shared displays, telepresence systems) that are part of the system infrastructure.

2. **No Collaborative Devices**: The organization does not use or maintain any collaborative computing devices that are integrated with or provide access to the system. All system access occurs through standard web browsers on user-owned devices (laptops, desktops, mobile devices).

3. **User-Controlled Devices**: Any collaborative computing devices that users may use (such as video conferencing systems for meetings) are user-controlled and not part of the system infrastructure. The system itself does not include or integrate with collaborative computing devices.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to organizational collaborative computing devices that are part of the system infrastructure and require usage restrictions and implementation guidance. Since the system is a web application with no integrated collaborative devices, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the system is a web application with no integrated collaborative computing devices. All system access occurs through standard web browsers, and the organization does not deploy or maintain collaborative computing devices as part of the system infrastructure.

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to implement controls for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **Web Application Architecture**: The system is a web application accessed through standard web browsers. The system does not include, integrate with, or provide VoIP functionality as part of its core capabilities.

2. **No VoIP Functionality**: The organization does not deploy, manage, or maintain any VoIP systems, VoIP infrastructure, or VoIP services as part of the system. The system does not provide voice communication capabilities, VoIP calling features, or integration with VoIP technologies.

3. **System Scope**: The system is designed for web-based data management and compliance tracking. It does not include voice communication features, telephony services, or VoIP components that would require control implementation.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to organizational VoIP systems and services that are part of the system infrastructure and require security controls. Since the system is a web application with no VoIP functionality, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because the system is a web application with no VoIP functionality. The system does not include, integrate with, or provide VoIP services, and therefore does not require VoIP control implementation.

#### Implementation Details

**Summary:** ## 4. Implementation Evidence

### 4.1 Code Implementation

### 4.2 System/Configuration Evidence

### 4.3 Operational Procedures

#### Verification Details

**Justification/Rationale for Not Applicable Status:**

This control requires organizations to prevent remote devices from maintaining simultaneous non-remote and remote connections. However, this control is not applicable to our environment because:

1. **All Access is Remote**: The system operates entirely in a cloud environment (Railway platform), and all user access to the system is remote. There are no non-remote connections to the system, as the organization does not maintain any on-premises infrastructure or local network connections.

2. **No Non-Remote Connections**: The organization does not maintain any on-premises infrastructure, local area networks, or direct physical connections to system components. All system access occurs remotely through web browsers over the internet.

3. **Cloud-Only Architecture**: The system infrastructure is entirely cloud-based, and users access the system from remote locations (home, office, mobile) using standard web browsers. There are no scenarios where a device could maintain both a non-remote and remote connection simultaneously.

4. **Control Scope**: This control applies to environments where devices can maintain both non-remote (local network) and remote (internet) connections simultaneously. Since all system access is remote with no non-remote connections possible, this control is outside the scope of our system architecture.

**Conclusion**: This control is not applicable because all system access is remote, and there are no non-remote connections to the system. The system architecture does not support scenarios where dual connections (non-remote and remote) could occur simultaneously.
