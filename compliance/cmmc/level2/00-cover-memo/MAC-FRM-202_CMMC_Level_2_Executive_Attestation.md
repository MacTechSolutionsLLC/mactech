## Executive Attestation Statement

I, the undersigned authorized official, hereby attest that:

**All 110 NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 controls required for CMMC Level 2 are addressed through implementation, inheritance, or active POA&M management** in the MacTech Solutions system in accordance with CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (Advanced) requirements.

**Current Implementation Status:**
- CMMC Level 2 includes 110 controls aligned to NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2
- **90 controls (82%) are fully implemented** by the organization
- **10 controls (9%) are inherited** from service providers (Railway, GitHub)
- **10 controls (9%) are not applicable** due to cloud-only architecture
- **Overall control readiness: 100%** (implemented + inherited)
- **CUI is handled by FIPS-validated cryptography** via Ubuntu 22.04 OpenSSL Cryptographic Module (FIPS provider)

**POA&M Management:**
All POA&M items have been remediated. All controls are implemented:
- Documented deficiency descriptions
- Planned remediation activities
- Assigned responsible roles
- Target completion timeframes (all ≤ 180 days)
- Regular review and tracking per POA&M Process Procedure

This attestation confirms that all 110 controls are implemented, inherited, or documented as not applicable, achieving full compliance with CMMC 2.0 Level 2 requirements. CUI is handled by FIPS-validated cryptography via Ubuntu 22.04 OpenSSL Cryptographic Module (FIPS provider) operating in FIPS-approved mode.

This attestation is based on:
- Comprehensive self-assessment of all 110 CMMC Level 2 controls
- Review of system architecture, policies, and procedures
- Evidence-based assessment of control implementation
- Documentation of implemented, inherited, and not-implemented controls
- System Control Traceability Matrix (SCTM) verification

**Effective Date:** 2026-01-24

**Assessment Date:** 2026-01-24

**Note:** This attestation must be signed by an authorized official with authority to bind the organization.

## Controls Attestation

I attest that the following CMMC Level 2 controls (110 total NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 controls) are implemented, inherited, or tracked in POA&M:

**Implementation Status Summary:**
- **Controls Implemented Internally:** 90 controls (82%)
- **Controls Inherited from Platform Providers:** 10 controls (9%) - Railway and GitHub infrastructure
- **Controls Not Applicable:** 10 controls (9%) - Cloud-only architecture
- **Total Controls:** 110
- **Overall Readiness:** 100% (Implemented + Inherited)

**CUI Protection:**
- ✅ CUI is handled by FIPS-validated cryptography via Ubuntu 22.04 OpenSSL Cryptographic Module (FIPS provider) operating in FIPS-approved mode
- ✅ CUI vault TLS/HTTPS fully FIPS-validated
- ✅ CUI vault kernel FIPS mode enabled, FIPS provider active

**Key Implemented Controls Include:**
- FIPS-validated cryptography for CUI protection (Control 3.13.11) - CUI is handled by FIPS-validated cryptography via Ubuntu 22.04 OpenSSL Cryptographic Module (FIPS provider)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for privileged accounts (Control 3.5.3)
- Account lockout after failed login attempts (Control 3.1.8)
- Comprehensive audit logging with 90-day retention (Control 3.3.1)
- CUI file storage and protection with password protection (Controls 3.1.3, 3.1.19, 3.1.21, 3.1.22)
- Separation of duties with role-based access control (Control 3.1.4)
- POA&M tracking and management system (Control 3.12.2)
- System Control Traceability Matrix (SCTM) with admin editing (Control 3.12.4)

**Implementation Details:**
- Certain infrastructure-related controls (TLS/HTTPS, database encryption, platform malware protection, physical security) are inherited from platform providers (Railway, GitHub).
- All organizational responsibilities (authentication, authorization, access controls, logging, incident response, configuration management, etc.) are implemented internally.
- For detailed breakdown of implemented vs inherited controls, see Inherited Controls Appendix (`03-control-responsibility/MAC-RPT-312_Inherited_Controls_Appendix.md`).
- For complete control status, see System Control Traceability Matrix (`04-self-assessment/MAC-AUD-408_System_Control_Traceability_Matrix.md`).

**System Scope:** This system is scoped to CMMC 2.0 Level 2 CUI enclave. The system processes, stores, and transmits Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) as defined by 32 CFR Part 2002 and the CUI Registry. CUI files are stored separately with admin authentication and audit logging controls.

**Evidence:** See `04-self-assessment/MAC-AUD-408_System_Control_Traceability_Matrix.md` for detailed assessment of each control.

**Attestation Limitations:**
This attestation is based on evidence available as of the assessment date. Inherited controls are documented per the Inherited Controls Appendix. Provider security documentation and evidence are available upon request.

## Penalty Acknowledgment

I understand that:

**False Statements:** Knowingly and willfully making a false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in this attestation is a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 and may result in:
- Criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment
- Civil penalties
- Contract termination
- Debarment from federal contracting

**Accuracy:** This attestation is accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief based on:
- Review of system documentation
- Assessment of control implementation
- Evidence-based evaluation of practices

**Ongoing Compliance:** I understand that this attestation represents the system's compliance status as of the effective date. Ongoing compliance requires continued implementation and monitoring of controls.
