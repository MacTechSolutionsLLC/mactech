## 2. Implementation Status

**Status:** 🚫 Not Applicable

**Status Description:**  
Control is not applicable to system architecture (justification provided)

**Justification:**  
This control is not applicable because the system operates entirely in a cloud environment (Railway platform). The organization does not maintain physical infrastructure, wireless networks, or on-premises equipment that would require this control.

**System Architecture:**
- Cloud-hosted application (Railway)
- No organizational wireless infrastructure
- No physical media handling
- No on-premises equipment
- All access is remote via web browser

**Control Scope:**
This control applies to organizational infrastructure and equipment that the organization directly manages. Since the system is entirely cloud-based and the organization does not maintain such infrastructure, this control is not applicable.

**Last Assessment Date:** 2026-01-24
