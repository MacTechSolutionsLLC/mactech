## Team Leader Quote

> "I've litigated complex contract disputes and seen how small risks become big problems. This module doesn't just identify risks—it predicts disputes, assesses liability, and recommends mitigation strategies. It's the difference between reactive legal defense and proactive risk management. Catch issues before they become lawsuits."
