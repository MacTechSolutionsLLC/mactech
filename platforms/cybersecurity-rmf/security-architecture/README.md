# Security Architecture & Baseline Controls Platform

**Domain:** Cybersecurity & RMF (Patrick Caruso)  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

Security architecture reviews and baseline security controls formulation for space systems and DoD environments, with standardized cybersecurity practices, security control design, and architecture-driven risk mitigation.

## Team Leader Quote

> "I've led architecture reviews and formulated baseline security controls for space systems at Northrop Grumman. The key is standardizing cybersecurity practices across program architectures while ensuring each system has the right controls for its risk profile. This platform automates security architecture design, validates controls against requirements, and ensures consistency across large corporate infrastructures."
