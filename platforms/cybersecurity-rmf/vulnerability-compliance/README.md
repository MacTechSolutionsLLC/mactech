## Team Leader Quote

> "I've vetted software with CVE analysis for program approval and performed HBSS/EVSS scans across classified systems. The challenge is keeping up with vulnerabilities, ensuring proper mitigation, and maintaining compliance. This platform automates CVE analysis, tracks vulnerabilities through their lifecycle, and ensures nothing is missed in the approval process."
