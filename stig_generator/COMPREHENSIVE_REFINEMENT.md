# Comprehensive Refinement Summary

## Issues Found in Newly Generated Files

### 1. Classification Too Permissive ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: 359/368 (97.5%) marked as "automatable" when target is 70-80%
- User feedback: "didn't catch enough manual checks"

**Root Cause**: 
- Default logic was too permissive: "If check commands exist → scannable"
- Not checking for manual review indicators in check_text
- Not checking for complex manual setup in fix_text

**Fix Applied**:
- Added more manual check indicators: "review the", "verify that", "upgrade to", "disk encryption", "document the", "potential command", "not recognized"
- Added complex manual indicators: "configure the operating system to implement", "following the steps below"
- Now checks both check_text AND fix_text for manual indicators
- More selective default: Requires both check commands AND real commands, AND no manual indicators

**Expected Result**: Should now catch 20-30% as "Not Scannable with Nessus"

### 2. Terminology Not Updated ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Generated files still show "Automatable: 359" and "Manual: 9" instead of "Scannable with Nessus"

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ `app/generators/ansible_hardening.py` - Updated header to show "Scannable with Nessus" with percentage
- ✅ `app/generators/ansible_checker.py` - Updated header and tags to use new terminology
- ✅ All tag references updated: `validate_scannable_with_nessus` / `validate_not_scannable_with_nessus`

### 3. CTP Only Has 10 Rows ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**Problem**: CTP CSV only has 10 rows (header + 9 controls) when it should have rows for all 368 controls

**Possible Causes**:
- WebUI might be filtering controls before generating CTP
- CTP generator might be receiving only not_scannable controls
- Need to verify input to CTP generator

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced manual verification step to extract commands from check_text even if not perfect
- Improved expected result extraction for manual controls
- Better action command generation for controls without valid commands

### 4. CTP Language Issues ✅ FIXED (in code, needs regeneration)

**Problems Found**:
- Still has "Must: ... If it does not, this is a finding."
- "Manual verification:" prefix in commands
- Incomplete/placeholder commands

**Status**: Refinements are in place in `scripts/generate_ctp.py`:
- `_extract_expected_result()` removes policy language
- `_clean_command()` removes backticks and filters incomplete commands
- Post-processing removes remaining policy language

**Next Step**: Regenerate CTP to see clean output

## Changes Made

### Classification Logic (`app/classifiers/automatable.py`)

1. **Enhanced Manual Indicators**:
   - Added: "upgrade to", "disk encryption", "document the", "potential command", "not recognized"
   - Added complex manual indicators from fix_text

2. **More Selective Default**:
   - Before: If check commands exist → scannable
   - After: Requires check commands AND real commands AND no manual indicators

3. **Better Manual Detection**:
   - Checks both check_text and fix_text for manual indicators
   - Marks as not scannable if manual review is required, even if commands exist

### Terminology Updates

1. **Headers**:
   - `"Automatable: X"` → `"Scannable with Nessus: X (Y%)"`
   - `"Manual: X"` → `"Not Scannable with Nessus: X (Y%)"`

2. **Tags**:
   - `validate_automatable` → `validate_scannable_with_nessus`
   - `validate_manual` → `validate_not_scannable_with_nessus`

3. **Comments**:
   - `"Automation: Automatable"` → `"Scannability: Scannable with Nessus"`

### CTP Generator (`scripts/generate_ctp.py`)

1. **Enhanced Manual Verification**:
   - Tries to extract commands from check_text even if not perfect
   - Better expected result extraction
   - Improved action command generation

2. **Language Cleaning** (already in place):
   - Removes "Must:" prefixes
   - Removes "If it does not, this is a finding." suffixes
   - Removes backticks from commands
   - Filters incomplete commands

## Expected Results After Regeneration

### Classification
- **Before**: 359 scannable (97.5%), 9 not scannable (2.5%)
- **After**: ~260-290 scannable (70-80%), ~78-108 not scannable (20-30%)

### Headers
- Hardening: `"Scannable with Nessus: 275 (75%)"`
- Checker: `"Scannable with Nessus: 275 (75%)"`

### Tags
- All tasks tagged with `scannable_with_nessus` or `not_scannable_with_nessus`

### CTP
- Should have rows for ALL 368 controls
- Clean language (no "Must:", no "If it does not...")
- Commands without backticks
- Better action commands for manual controls

## Next Steps

1. **Regenerate all artifacts**:
   ```bash
   # Parse with updated classification
   python scripts/parse_stig.py \
     --xccdf stigs/data/U_RHEL_8_STIG_V2R5_Manual-xccdf.xml \
     --output data/json/rhel8_v2r5_controls.json
   
   # Generate with updated terminology
   python scripts/generate_hardening.py \
     --input data/json/rhel8_v2r5_controls.json \
     --output output/ansible/stig_rhel8_hardening.yml \
     --product rhel8
   
   python scripts/generate_checker.py \
     --input data/json/rhel8_v2r5_controls.json \
     --output output/ansible/stig_rhel8_checker.yml \
     --product rhel8
   
   python scripts/generate_ctp.py \
     --input data/json/rhel8_v2r5_controls.json \
     --output output/ctp/stig_rhel8_ctp.csv
   ```

2. **Verify**:
   - Check classification percentages (should be 70-80% scannable)
   - Check terminology is updated throughout
   - Check CTP has rows for all controls
   - Check CTP language is clean

3. **If CTP still has only 10 rows**:
   - Check if WebUI is filtering controls
   - Verify CTP generator is receiving all controls
   - Check for any filtering logic in the generator

## Status

✅ **Classification**: Refined to be more balanced (70-80% target)
✅ **Terminology**: Updated throughout codebase
✅ **CTP Language**: Refinements in place (needs regeneration)
⚠️ **CTP Row Count**: Needs investigation - should have rows for all controls

All code changes are complete. Ready for regeneration and testing.
