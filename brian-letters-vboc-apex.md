Dear VBOC New England Team,

I am writing to introduce MacTech Solutions and to explore opportunities for collaboration and support as we continue to grow our veteran-owned business in the federal contracting space.

I am Brian MacDonald, Managing Member for Compliance & Operations at MacTech Solutions. MacTech is a veteran-owned small business specializing in cybersecurity, infrastructure engineering, quality assurance, and compliance services for federal programs and defense contractors. Our team brings deep expertise in Risk Management Framework (RMF) implementation, authorization processes, ISO compliance, and audit readiness—all critical capabilities for DoD and federal information systems.

As a veteran-owned business, we understand the unique challenges and opportunities in federal contracting. We are particularly focused on VetCert-eligible opportunities, especially those in cybersecurity and RMF domains. Our services are organized into four pillars of expertise—Security, Infrastructure, Quality, and Governance—each led by senior practitioners with proven track records in federal programs.

We would welcome the opportunity to:
- Learn more about VBOC New England's services and resources for veteran-owned businesses
- Explore potential partnership opportunities to support other veteran-owned businesses
- Participate in VBOC programs, workshops, or networking events
- Receive guidance on federal contracting opportunities and certifications

MacTech is committed to supporting the veteran business community and would be honored to work with VBOC New England to advance our shared mission of helping veteran-owned businesses succeed in federal contracting.

I would appreciate the opportunity to schedule a brief call or meeting to discuss how we might collaborate. Please let me know your availability, and I will coordinate accordingly.
